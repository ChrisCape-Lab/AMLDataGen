==== IMPROVEMENTS ====
 - New patterns: cash-in, cash_out, occasional_mule
 - Possible multi-class classification due to role organization (source, layer, dest)
 - Simple, compact, customizable and extensible


Issues
 - low available data to imitate
 - performance issue with large instances
 - variable structures and behaviour
